    Software is a program that enables a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system (hardware).
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes application software such as a word processor, which enables a user to perform a task, and system software such as an operating system, which enables other software to run properly, by interfacing with hardware and with other software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practical computer systems divide software into three major classes: system software, programming software and application software, although the distinction is arbitrary, and often blurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer software has to be "loaded" into the computer's storage (such as a hard drive, memory, or RAM).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the software is loaded, the computer is able to execute the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computers operate by executing the computer program.
    </p>
    <p>
      This involves passing instructions from the application software, through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation -- moving data, carrying out a computation, or altering the control flow of instructions.
    </p>
  <h3>
    Software can be categorized according to what it is designed to accomplish. There are two main types of software: systems software and application software.
  </h3>
  <h1>
    Systems Software
  </h1>
  <p>
    Systems software includes the programs that are dedicated to managing the computer itself, such as the operating system, file management utilities, and disk operating system (or DOS). The operating system manages the computer hardware resources in addition to applications and data. Without systems software installed in our computers we would have to type the instructions for everything we wanted the computer to do!
  </p>
  <h1>
    Applications Software
  </h1>
  <p>
    Application software, or simply applications, are often called productivity programs or end-user programs because they enable the user to complete tasks, such as creating documents, spreadsheets, databases and publications, doing online research, sending email, designing graphics, running businesses, and even playing games! Application software is specific to the task it is designed for and can be as simple as a calculator application or as complex as a word processing application. When you begin creating a document, the word processing software has already set the margins, font style and size, and the line spacing for you. But you can change these settings, and you have many more formatting options available. For example, the word processor application makes it easy to add color, headings, and pictures or delete, copy, move, and change the document's appearance to suit your needs.
